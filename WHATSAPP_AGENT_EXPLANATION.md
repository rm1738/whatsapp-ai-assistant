## Recent Improvements (Latest Update)

### Enhanced Natural Language Understanding for Calendar Operations

The system has been significantly improved to better understand human language patterns, especially for calendar management:

#### Smarter "Upcoming Week" Interpretation
- **Context-Aware Logic:** When users say "upcoming week", the system now considers the current day of the week
- **Early Week (Mon-Wed):** "Upcoming week" includes from today through the next Sunday (current + next week)
- **Late Week (Thu-Sun):** "Upcoming week" means the following calendar week
- **Result:** More intuitive behavior that matches human expectations

#### Expanded Deletion Patterns
The system now understands these natural language patterns:
- **Broad Patterns:** "Delete all my meetings", "Remove all events", "Cancel everything"
- **Time-Specific:** "Clear my calendar for the upcoming week"
- **Flexible Weekdays:** "Delete meetings next Monday" vs "Delete meetings this Monday"
- **Relative Periods:** "Remove events for the next 7 days", "Cancel rest of the week"

#### Technical Improvements
- **Better Date Range Calculation:** More accurate interpretation of relative dates
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Clearer feedback when events aren't found
- **Debug Logging:** Better troubleshooting for complex date queries
- **Contextual Intelligence:** System considers current date/time when interpreting requests

#### Examples of Improved Understanding
**Before:** "Delete all my meetings for the upcoming week" ‚Üí Failed (looked only at next calendar week)
**After:** "Delete all my meetings for the upcoming week" ‚Üí Success (includes current week events when appropriate)

**Before:** "Cancel everything" ‚Üí Not understood
**After:** "Cancel everything" ‚Üí Deletes all upcoming events (next 7 days)

**Before:** "Remove events for next Monday" ‚Üí Sometimes incorrect week
**After:** "Remove events for next Monday" ‚Üí Always gets the correct next Monday

This update makes the assistant much more intuitive and human-like in understanding calendar-related requests, reducing frustration and improving user experience.
